This web platform serves as an interface for interacting with the Neo4j database. Uses FlaskLogin for user authentication and credential management, integrated with the schema defined in Neomodel. Key features of the platform include:

* A dashboard displaying the latest experimental data and metadata.
* The ability to add extra metadata to entities.
* A semantically structured section to create the configuration of the experiment:
  * Define groups of bioreactors.
  * Assign specific strains to each bioreactor.
  * Select a computational algorithm to be applied at specific workflow stages.
  * Designate people responsible in different roles.
* Visualize historical data through different plots
* Access to PG-Schema definition.
* User profile editing capabilities.
* Link to the Apache Airflow platform.
